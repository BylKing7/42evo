# PartII:

The list of the projects on the 42 Quebec cursus. 

You will find in this folder every project I had to do for the Learner cursus.

## Libft
C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to the highly useful
standard functions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work,
implementing and learning to use them. Your will create your own library. It will be
helpful since you will use it in your next C school assignments.
Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year. However, when working
on a new project, don’t forget to ensure the functions used in your library are allowed in
the project guidelines.

## Printf
You will discover a popular and versatile C function: printf(). This exercise is a great
opportunity to improve your programming skills. It is of moderate difficulty.
You will discover variadic functions in #C.
The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and extensible code.

## Born2BeRoot
This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization.
You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you can’t use VirtualBox)
under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up
your own operating system while implementing strict rules.

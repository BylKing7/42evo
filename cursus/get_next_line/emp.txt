The function returns the next line from the [fd] with its respective 
or the last line of the file. It returns null if there's nothing to read
or if an error occurs.
This function copies BUFFER_SIZE bytes from the string [buffer] to the
static variable [stash] until a newline is found or the end of file is
reached.
If a newline is found in the cumulative buffer [stash], the contents until
'\n' are copied to line and the rest is stored again in [stash]. If no
newline is found, the whole content of [stash] is copied to line and [stash] 
points to NULL.
